Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering methods, principles and tools to develop and maintain a high-quality software system.  It plays an important role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software systems and applications that help in various aspects of modern life including healthcare, entertainment, commerce, and communication.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 Development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
 Design - Creating high-level and detailed software architecture and user interface designs.
 Implementation - Write code and build the software according to the design specifications.
 Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
 Deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers.
 Maintenance -Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software.
 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a rigid, sequential approach and would be best for Projects with clear, stable requirements and low risk, while Agile emphasizes collaboration and incremental development which is best for  Projects with uncertain requirements, competitive markets, or rapid technological changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for ensuring the software quality.
A Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of the software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code they include Visual Studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
VCS are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members they include Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements during the software development cycle can lead to project delays
Tight deadlines which can result in compromised software quality.
Technical debt increasing maintenance cost
These challenges can be overcomed through, task prioritization, effective communication, agile methodologies and regular reassessment of timelines and goals.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
They help in identifying and fixing defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions and instructions clearly and specifically, so the AI understands exactly what the user needs to get the best responses from the AI assistant.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- Tell me about dogs.
Improved prompt- write the history of the German shepherd dogs 
The improved prompt is clear, specific and concise and will get a more focused response
